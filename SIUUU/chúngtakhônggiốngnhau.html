        The town inside me
        And everyone's voice
        Only I'm not there
        Just watching from afar
        I can't go home
        Because I'm afraid
        Something will change
        Me without me
        I'm the one to blame

        I've moved on, by my own will
        (I had nothing else I wanted to do)
        It wasn't hard, but I didn't hate it
        (I did not even like it)
        I've been patient, but it was bearable
        I've had a gray haze for a long time though (Boom boom)
        I never found out, what it was I
        It's my stress, that's for sure
        I never wanted to run away
        (I was vеry motivated)
        Then what is, this feeling?
        (Who would I ask?)

        I've been patiеnt, but it was bearable
        I've had a gray haze for a long time though (Boom boom)
        I never found out, what it was I-
        Tastes like vegetables I don't like

        The town inside me
        And everyone's voice
        Only I'm not there
        Just watching from afar
        I can't go home
        Because I'm afraid
        Something will change
        Me without me
        I'm the one to blame

        I'm not waiting
        (For Santa Claus)
        I already have the gifts just can't open the box (just can't open the box)
        I know all about it, no one can stop it
        Unless I just had to do something 'bout it
        "It's not even a case!"
        I've been patient, but it was bearable
        I've had a gray haze for a long time though (Boom boom)
        I never found out, what it was I
        I hate the alarm clock I chose


        The town inside me
        And everyone's voice
        Only I'm not there
        Just watching from afar
        I can't go home
        Because I'm afraid
        Something will change
        Me without me
        I'm the one to blame


        I'm out of patience, my body is a lie
        Let's paint the gray haze into sky blue
        I know who you are!
        I'm not leaving you again!


        The town inside me
        And everyone's voice
        Only I'm not there
        Just watching from afar
        There is no where to go that- no where to go
        It's all just food y'know
        Me without me (I'm the one to blame)
        The night falls, the place where I belong
        No matter what changes, will no longer change me
        No matter what- change- no no no longer change me
        I can feel the light, even after the sun goes down
